# Shard :gem:

## What is Shard?
Shard is a Chrome extension that saves tabs within the currently active window into organized bookmarks. It can then be used to quickly open tabs in a new window, allowing you to start from wherever you've left off.

Shard can be used to:

* keep track of those useful pages you found for your research project that you don't wish to do a search for again.
* open all of your favorite news and multimedia sites in a click of a button.
* save "browser-workspaces" consisting of all of the combinations of pages you need to be productive.

## Future Features
Shard can currently:

* store all tabs in the active window to a user-named bookmark folder.
* open all tabs in a folder in a new window at the click of a button.
* assign folders gemstone names by default. 

In the future, users should be able to:

* modify folder names from within the extension.
* view and modify folder contents.
* add new tabs to an existing folder.
* delete folders (w/o going into the bookmark manager).
* use defined macros to speed-up process.

## Why the name?
Shard can gather all open tabs (shards) in the current window and place them in a folder that you name (gem).
You can look through the gems that you've created and shatter them to restore a previous "session".
