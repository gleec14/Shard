# Shard

Shard is a Chrome web extension that saves window sessions in organized bookmarks.

If you choose to, Shard can gather all open tabs (shards) in the current window and place them in a folder that you name (gem).

With Shard, you can look through the gems that you've created and shatter them to restore a previous session.
