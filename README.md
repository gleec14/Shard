# Shard :gem:

## What is Shard?
Shard is a Chrome extension that saves tabs within the currently active window into organized bookmarks. It can then be used to quickly open tabs in a new window, allowing you to start from wherever you've left off.

Shard can be used to:

* keep track of those useful pages you found for your research project that you don't wish to do a search for again.
* open all of your favorite news and multimedia sites in a click of a button.
* save "browser-workspaces" consisting of all of the combinations of pages you need to be productive.

## Installation
1) Clone this repo.
2) Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer mode."
3) Click "Load unpacked".
4) Select the path to the repo.

## Usage
1) Click on the window with the tabs you want to store.
2) Click the extension and name the folder.
3) Click "Create New Gem."
4) Click the card that just popped up to open the tabs in a new window.

## Future Features
Shard can currently:

* store all tabs in the active window to a user-named bookmark folder.
* open all tabs in a folder in a new window at the click of a button.
* assign folders gemstone names by default.

In the future, users should be able to:

* view and modify folder contents.
* add new tabs to an existing folder.
* use macros to load or save without clicking the extension. \
:white_check_mark: modify folder names from within the extension. \
:white_check_mark: delete folders (w/o going into the bookmark manager).

## Why the name?
Shard can gather all open tabs (shards) in the current window and place them in a folder that you name (gem).
You can look through the gems that you've created and shatter them to restore a previous "session".
